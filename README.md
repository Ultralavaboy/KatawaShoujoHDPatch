__Enjoy a good story in a good quality!__

## Description
Katawa Shoujo is a visual novel by Four Leaf Studios that tells the story of a young man and five young women living with varying disabilities. 

The game had been in development since 2007, and it was released on January 4, 2012. It was quite a long time ago, wasn’t it?  
The official game is available only in resolution 800x600. It’s actually not that good for *visual* novel in 2021.

Katawa Shoujo HD patch is going to give this (g)old story a HD shell.

Languages available:
* English
* Spanish
* French
* Japanese
* German
* Russian

## Comparison

Screenshots below are presented in their original size - 1920x1080 (with patch) and 800x600 (original).

And for example, that's how Lilly's sprite appears in fullscreen mode.

This wideness of an original image happens because of stretching window from 4:3 to 16:9. In HD version it looks better and naturally.
