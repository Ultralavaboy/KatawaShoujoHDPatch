__Enjoy a good story in a good quality!__

## Description
Katawa Shoujo is a visual novel by Four Leaf Studios that tells the story of a young man and five young women living with varying disabilities. 

The game had been in development since 2007, and it was released on January 4, 2012. It was quite a long time ago, wasn’t it?  
The official game is available only in resolution 800x600. It’s actually not that good for *visual* novel in 2021.

Katawa Shoujo HD patch is going to give this (g)old story a HD shell.

Languages available:
* English
* Spanish
* French
* Japanese
* German
* Russian

## Comparison

Screenshots below are presented in their original sizes: 1920x1080 (with patch) and 800x600 (original).

And for example, that's how Lilly's sprite appears in fullscreen mode.

This wideness of the original image happens because of the stretching of the window from 4:3 to 16:9. In the HD version, it looks better and more naturally.

## MacOS
GitHub user [112c](https://github.com/112cxyz) made a macOS version of the game's patch!

[Download](https://dropover.cloud/0b5671)

MacOS uses Renpy 6.99, which has a rewritten save engine and can't load older saves, you will still get the widgets on the main menu from the old game. The game also has a chance of showing an error when quitting, but can be ignored by pressing the quit button again or on the error.
